# Sunlight Congress

Sunlight Congress implements an IQueryable pattern for interacting with the Sunlight Foundation API. 
This means that you can use standard Lambda expressions inside of a where clause on each of the queryable objects.

### Getting Started

Before we get started, you'll need to register for an API key with the Sunlight Foundation - 
http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/accounts/register/


### Creating your client
`Client client = new Client("Your Sunlight Foundation API Key");`

##### Your client contains 12 queryable objects
- Amendments
- Bills
- Committees
- CongressionalDocuments
- Districts
- Documents
- FloorUpdates
- Hearings
- Legislators
- Nominations
- UpcomingBills
- Votes


### Examples
- Let's get all of the Senate votes that happened in 2016

`Vote[] votes = client.Votes.Where(x => x.Year == 2016 && x.Chamber == "senate").ToArray();`

Once you have this array, you can manipulate it as you could any other IEnumerable, with further Lambda queries on the dataset, for example, here we'll get all the Bill Id's from that previous query, and put them into a string array.

`string[] billIds = votes.Select(x => x.BillId).ToArray();`

- All bills
 
```Bill[] bills = congress.Bills.ToArray();```

- All congressional votes where more than 30 Republicans voted Yea
 
```Vote[] republicanVotes = congress.Votes.Where(xy => xy.Breakdown.Party.Republican.Yea > 30).ToArray();```

- All legislators in Beverly Hills
 
```Legislator[] bhLegislators = congress.Legislators.Where(x => x.Zip == 90210).ToArray();```

- All bills containing the following phrase

```Bill[] hydroelectric = congress.Bills.Where(x => x.Query == "To authorize the expansion of an existing hydroelectric project.").ToArray();```
